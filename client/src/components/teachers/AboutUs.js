          <p className="lead">Much like the original Esperanto language that was created over 100 years ago in an attempt to connect people worldwide, as a team of developers ranging from diverse international backgrounds, we too wished to create a platform that took these principles into the internet age. A new Esperanto. </p>
          <h6 className="h6">The Website</h6>
          <p className="lead">Esperanto is a global language learning community that connects students and teachers for 1-on-1 online language lessons. Weâ€™re passionate about allowing everyone to learn languages in the most personalized and authentic way possible while also offering great flexibility for our teachers.</p>
